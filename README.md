# Decentralized Disaster Response Network (DDRN)

## Overview

The Decentralized Disaster Response Network (DDRN) is a project that showcases the working of various internet protocols in a disaster response scenario. The project uses multiple devices to simulate real-time communication and coordination among distributed nodes, ensuring reliable data transfer and efficient communication during critical situations.

## Features

- **TCP Communication**: Reliable data exchange between devices.
- **UDP Communication**: Lightweight message exchange for non-critical updates.
- **MQTT Messaging**: Real-time alerts and sensor data communication.
- **HTTPS Requests**: Secure data retrieval from external sources.
- **Blockchain Logging**: Immutable logging of critical events.

## Use Cases
- **Disaster Response**: Real-time communication and coordination.
- **Data Integrity**: Immutable logging with blockchain.
